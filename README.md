# Old School Games
This was a project for a class where I created a game library of several games using html, css, and js. This focus of this project was the UI and UX of the web page.
I implemented a sleek black and white design after creating a prototype of the webpage and then created custome logos in adobe for the index page and all of the different games. 
For the webpages I wanted all of the games to match having an index page button as well as each game having a description page.
